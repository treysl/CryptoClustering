# CryptoClustering

In this analysis, I will be utilizing my extensive knowledge of Python programming and unsupervised learning techniques to predict whether or not cryptocurrencies will be impacted by either 24-hour or 7-day price changes. With the growing popularity of digital currencies and the ever-changing landscape of the financial industry, it is imperative to stay ahead of the curve and leverage advanced analytical tools and techniques to gain insights into market trends and fluctuations. By utilizing unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, I will be able to effectively identify patterns and relationships within large sets of cryptocurrency data, which can then be used to make accurate predictions about future price changes.
